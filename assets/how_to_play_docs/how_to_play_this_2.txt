The next question is if you want the coordinate filled or empty.

If you know this is a filled square choose "F", for filled.
If you know this square can not be filled, choose "E" for empty.

If you choose to mark the squares which you know can't be filled,
the game will be easier to solve.

If you change your mind, you can choose the same coordinate again to 
change from filled square to empty or vice versa.

When you think you are done placing the squares. Type an "X" and
you will get the result of your game.

When all the dots on the board has been replaced by either a filled
or an empty square, the game will automatically finish.

You can always type "Q" to quit or "R" to restart the game.

Good Luck!
