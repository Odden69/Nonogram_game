If you choose to mark the squares which you know can't be filled,
the game will be easier to solve.

If you change your mind, you can choose the same coordinate again to 
change from filled square to empty or vice versa.

When you think you are done placing the squares. Type an "X" and
you will get the result of your game.

When all the dots on the board has been replaced by either a filled
or an empty square, the game will automatically finish.

You can always type "Q" to quit or "R" to restart the game.

Good Luck!
