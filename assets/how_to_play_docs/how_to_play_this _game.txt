If yout don't know how a Nonogram works, please read the common
rules first.

The letters to the right and the numbers on the bottom gives the
coordinate of each dot on the board.

Enter the coordinate you like to add a square to by entering the
letter first and then the number, e.g. A2.

The next question asks if you want it filled or empty.

If you know this is a filled square choose "F", for filled.
If you know this square can not be filled, choose "E" for empty.

If you choose to mark the squares which you know can't be filled,
the game will be easier to solve.

When you think you are done placing the squares. Type an "X" and
you will get the result of your game.

When all the dots on the board has been replaced by either a filled
or an empty square, the game will automatically finish.

You can always type "Q" to quit or "R" to restart the game.

Good Luck!
